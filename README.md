Share your setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you add / edit / remove oscillators to your setup you’ll notice the
URL hash value update accordingly. For example:  
  
…`#square,0.5,0.8;triangle,0.75,0.2;sine,1,0.3`  

This means you can bookmark and share your setup just by copying and
pasting the URL.
